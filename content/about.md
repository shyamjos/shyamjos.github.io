My name is Shyam Jos, I am a passionate Linux SysAdmin / DevOps Engineer from [Kochi, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi). I am a strong advocate of using Linux and Open-Source software. 

I am always looking for ways to improve my life by constantly learning new things. I love coding, Mostly small python/bash scripts, quick and handy solutions to problems I had, check out my [code on GitHub](https://github.com/shyamjos). I also love tinkering with development boards like [arduino](https://github.com/shyamjos/Arduino_ServerMon) and [raspberry pi](http://shyamjos.com/How-to-update-raspberrypi-firmware-in-kali-linux/). 

I would love to hear from you! Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:shyamjosepp+website@gmail.com) with any questions or comments
