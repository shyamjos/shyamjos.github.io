My name is Shyam Jos, I am a passionate Linux system administrator from [Kochi,India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi). I am a strong advocate of using Linux and Open-Source software. 

I am always looking for ways to improve my life by constantly learning new things. I love [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/shyamjos), On my free time I work on side projects, Mostly small python/bash scripts, quick and handy solutions to problems I had, check out my [code on GitHub](https://github.com/shyamjos). I also love tinkering with development boards like [arduino](https://github.com/shyamjos/Arduino_ServerMon) and [raspberry pi](http://shyamjos.com/How-to-update-raspberrypi-firmware-in-kali-linux/). 

I would love to hear from you! Feel free to send me an [email](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01uQjp5Tl_fOrnVuyzKC0UcQ==&c=Lqg5RQX3S_0KAS3137midPQ7xgK6dYMK9aOCRz7kD2s=) with any questions or comments
